## Summary

Leadline Marketing partnered with a Tulsa-based credit union aiming to boost awareness and drive signups for a checking account tailored to newcomers on their financial journey. With a modest target of 50 new applications, they launched a focused digital marketing campaign designed to connect emotionally — and effectively — with the community.

## Strategic Approach

1. **Ad Campaigns with Clear, Accessible Messaging**  
   Using conversational language and friendly visuals, the paid media ads emphasized key benefits like mobile banking, low fees, and local support. Taglines such as “Start your path to financial freedom” created a welcoming, modern brand tone.

2. **Local Influencer Partnerships to Build Trust**  
   Tulsa-based influencers shared lifestyle-driven content that naturally integrated financial education, positioning the credit union as a trusted, locally engaged brand.

3. **Retargeting to Accelerate Conversions**  
   Visitors who previously engaged with the website or ads were retargeted with reminders of the account benefits to stay top-of-mind during their decision-making process.

## Results

The campaign successfully exceeded its goal, generating a notable increase in checking account applications. Even with a reduced post-launch budget, the campaign maintained consistent performance—demonstrating effective messaging and channel choice.

## Why This Strategy Works for Community Banking

- Builds trust through locality and familiarity  
- Frames financial services as part of a customer’s journey  
- Leverages multi-channel outreach aligned with modern consumer behaviors
