## Summary

This article provides a comprehensive overview of what affects HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) rates for Tulsa homeowners and offers practical preparation tips. Triad Bank explains how both market conditions and individual financial profiles influence approval and terms.

## What Determines HELOC Rates

- **Market Interest Rates**: HELOC rates are variable and often tied to the prime rate, which can shift based on Federal Reserve policy.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**: The more equity you have in your home, the lower your LTV, which can lead to better borrowing terms.
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**: Lenders assess your existing debt to gauge whether you can responsibly manage additional credit.

## What Lenders Consider

Before approval, lenders evaluate:
- Your outstanding debt load and overall financial obligations  
- A property appraisal to assess your home’s current value  
- Your history of on-time payments and credit management  

## Preparation Checklist for Tulsa Homeowners

2. Gather income documentation (pay stubs, tax returns, W-2s)
